# MIS-310-Final

This project is a simple Python web application that ranks multiple resumes against a job description using AI text embeddings. It was created as a final project for an Intro to Programming / MIS course. The user enters or edits one job description and up to five resumes in a Gradio interface. The app then uses the OpenAI embeddings model (`text-embedding-3-small`) together with NumPy and scikit-learn to convert the texts into vectors, calculate cosine similarity between the job description and each resume, and display a ranked list of resumes from best to worst match with similarity scores.

To run the project, you install the required Python packages (`openai`, `gradio`, `python-dotenv`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`), set your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file, and execute `python final_project.py` to launch the Gradio app in your browser. The interface comes pre-filled with a sample job description and five sample resumes from the `sample_data` folder, but you can replace them with your own text. While the tool is useful for quickly comparing how closely resumes match a job posting, it only measures text similarity and depends on a stable internet connection and available OpenAI credits.
